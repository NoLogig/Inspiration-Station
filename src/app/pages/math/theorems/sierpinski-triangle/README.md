## Notes to Sierpinski & his contributions
*Wacław Franciszek Sierpiński (\*14 March 1882 – †21 October 1969)*
 was a Polish mathematician. He was known for contributions to **set theory** (research on the **axiom of choice** and the generalised **continuum hypothesis**), **number theory**, **theory of functions** and **topology**.

Well-known fractals are named after him (the **[Sierpinski triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpinski_triangle)**, the **Sierpinski carpet** and the **Sierpinski curve**), as are **Sierpinski numbers** and the associated **Sierpiński problem**.

### [Sierpinski triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpinski_triangle)

The **Sierpinski triangle**, also called the **Sierpinski gasket** or the **Sierpinski Sieve**, is a **fractal** and **attractive fixed set** with the overall *shape of an equilateral triangle, subdivided recursively into smaller equilateral triangles*. Originally constructed as a curve, this is one of the basic examples of *self-similar* sets, i.e., it is a mathematically generated pattern that is reproducible at any magnification or reduction.
