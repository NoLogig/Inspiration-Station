Fall asleep during a movie and be awakened by extremely loud sounds.

Sound effects are often incredibly loud, voices too quiet or dialogues are mumbled.
To make the sound sound more realistic, many directors decide to mix their sounds high dynamically - after all,
an explosion is very loud even in real life, voices much quieter in comparison.

But even when awake, volume jumps are annoying.
The music drowned out and makes watching movies & series as a torture!
